Death Clock – A Reminder That Time Is Ticking
Death Clock is a minimalist yet thought-provoking web app designed to remind us of the one thing we often forget: our limited time.

In this fast-paced world, we often delay dreams, goals, and even simple joys — thinking “there’s always tomorrow.” But what if you could see exactly how much time you might have left?

🚀 How It Works:
Enter your expected year of death.

The clock instantly starts counting down — days, hours, minutes, and seconds — showing the time remaining until that year.

A constantly running reminder that your time is finite — make every moment count.

🎯 Purpose:
This project isn’t meant to be morbid — it's a motivational tool. A visual cue to beat procrastination, take action today, and live with intention.
